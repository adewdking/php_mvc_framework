# php_mvc_framework
A PHP MVC framework organizes web applications into three components:  Model: Manages data and business logic. View: Handles the user interface and presentation. Controller: Processes user input and connects the Model and View. It promotes clean code, reusability, and separation of concerns, improving maintainability and scalability.
